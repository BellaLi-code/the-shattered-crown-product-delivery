# The Shattered Crown

## Agile Product Delivery Governance (Jira Implementation)

---

## Executive Summary

Designed and operationalized a full Scrum-based Agile delivery governance system in Jira for a milestone-driven game development project.

This repository demonstrates structured backlog architecture, sprint cadence control, release governance, and proactive risk management implemented to simulate an industry-grade product delivery environment.

All major milestones were delivered on schedule across five sprint cycles.

---

## Project Context

**Course:** CS4483 – Agile Product Delivery
**Team Size:** 3
**Duration:** 4 Months
**Product:** 2D Boss-Focused Action Game (Unity Prototype)

The objective extended beyond building a playable prototype.
The core focus was implementing a structured Agile delivery system reflecting real-world product execution standards.

# Governance Architecture

---

## 1. Backlog Hierarchy (Strategic Decomposition)

Deliverables → Epics → Stories → Subtasks

This structure ensured:

* Vertical traceability from milestone to task
* Scope containment
* Clear ownership boundaries
* Controlled backlog growth

---

## 2. Sprint Execution Board (Operational Control)

Implemented:

* Timeboxed sprint cadence
* WIP visibility
* Status transparency
* Definition of Done enforcement
* Iteration-level scope discipline

---

## 3. Release Governance (Milestone Control)

Versioned releases aligned with academic deliverables:

* D0 – Team Contract
* D1 – Project Proposal
* A1 – Activity 1
* D2 – Mid-Project Report

Enabled:

* Planned vs actual tracking
* Release-level visibility
* Scope alignment with deadlines

## 4. Risk Governance Framework

Implemented a structured risk register containing:

* Impact classification
* Probability level
* Risk owner
* Mitigation plan
* Due date
* Active monitoring state

### Mitigation Execution Example

Active risk mitigation linked directly to execution tasks:

## 5. Work Volume & Traceability

Maintained structured visibility across all work items:

* Task ownership clarity
* Workload balancing
* Auditability of changes
* Transparent history of execution

# My Role

* Designed Jira project structure and workflow architecture
* Established sprint cadence governance model
* Implemented structured risk tracking system
* Created release version control framework
* Defined milestone-level scope boundaries
* Maintained backlog decomposition and traceability
* Conducted weekly delivery alignment reviews

This project reflects ownership of delivery governance rather than passive participation.
