# The Shattered Crown – Agile Product Delivery (Jira)
Production-style Agile Scrum delivery simulation using Jira, demonstrating sprint governance, risk management, and stakeholder communication.

## Overview

This repository documents a production-simulated Agile delivery framework designed and executed using Jira to manage a 4-month milestone-driven CS game development initiative.

The objective was to replicate an industry-grade Scrum workflow, incorporating structured backlog hierarchy, sprint cadence governance, risk management, release oversight, and stakeholder transparency mechanisms.

This project simulates real-world product delivery management beyond academic task tracking.

---

## Project Scope

- Duration: 4 months
- 7 Epics
- 68 structured work items
- 5 sprint cycles
- 4 major deliverables
- 100% on-time milestone completion

---

## Delivery Architecture

The delivery structure was organized as:

Epic → Story → Task → Subtask

Each level contained:

- Clearly defined acceptance criteria
- Ownership mapping
- Due dates aligned to sprint cadence
- Release association
- Risk and dependency visibility

Backlog decomposition ensured milestone traceability from high-level deliverables down to executable implementation units.

---

## Sprint Governance Model

The project operated under a structured Scrum cadence:

- Sprint planning cycles
- Work item prioritization
- Capacity consideration
- Progress tracking through Jira boards
- Iterative backlog refinement

Execution governance included:

- Defined sprint goals
- Release alignment
- Controlled scope adjustments
- Work-in-progress visibility

---

## Risk & Quality Management

A structured governance layer was implemented to simulate production-level control mechanisms:

- Risk & Issue Log tracking
- Scope logging for change control
- Priority-based bug triage (P0 / P1 classification)
- Smoke test validation checkpoints
- Release-level oversight

This ensured proactive risk identification, quality visibility, and structured issue escalation pathways.

---

## Stakeholder Communication Framework

To simulate stakeholder alignment:

- Sprint review checkpoints
- Structured progress reporting
- Risk log updates
- Release-level transparency mechanisms

The communication model emphasized delivery visibility and alignment across contributors.
